### Isaac Morrow / Toranian
Hello! I'm a second year university student working towards becoming a computer scientist at the University of Victoria. I am very passionate about technology, and as a result, have explored many different aspects of the computer science world. This "hopping" around has left me with a basic understanding of many different disciplines, allowing me to work with many different technologies quickly and efficiently.
