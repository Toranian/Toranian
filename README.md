### Isaac Morrow / Toranian
Hello! I'm a second year university student working towards becoming a computer scientist at the University of Victoria. 

I've got an interest in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Recently I've been doing a bunch of Python + Django as I've been finding it super fun and interesting.
