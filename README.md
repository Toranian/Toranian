## Isaac Morrow
Driven third year university student at the University of Victoria working towards a computer science degree with a specialization in software systems at the University of Victoria.

### About me
I love anything programming, but especially enjoy computer architecture, operating systems, website development, and hobbiest electronics. Recently I've built the [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) which I love to use for programming, and pairs especially well with Vim! In my freetime you'll find me playing the guitar, reading, exploring, or running!

### What am I currently working on?
I am currently working on building my website development company, [Muon Design](https://muon.design). I am also currently employed at [Science Venture](https://www.scienceventure.ca/), where I actively engage youth in learning about computer science! In particular, I work as part of [CodeMakers](https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/google-announces-project-to-get-canadian-kids-coding-1.2785348) which is a Google funded [Actua](https://actua.ca/) program.

### Some of my non programming-related skillsets
- Creative problem solving
- Public speaking and speaking
- Effective and clear communication
- Leadership - Can effectively help unit a group or team to a common goal
- Requirements management - Can create relevant and unambiguous requirements to help implement a feature
