## Isaac Morrow / Toranian
Driven second year university student working towards becoming a computer scientist at the University of Victoria.

### About me
I've got an interest in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. As of late, I've found it hard to refuse any and all projects with others, and I'm having a blast. 

### What am I currently working on?
Currently working university related projects, but I'm now working to create an autonomous robot utilizing tools like Fusion 360, Arduino, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and 3D printing.
