### Isaac Morrow / Toranian
Driven second year university student working towards becoming a computer scientist at the University of Victoria.

I've got an interest in cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Recently I've been doing a bunch of Python + Django as I've been finding it super fun and interesting.
